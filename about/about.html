        Journalist Alan Isaacson provides a helpful study of this phenomenal
        ministry in his book “Deeper Life: The Extraordinary Growth of the
        Deeper Life Bible Church”, after talking with many members of the church
        who told him how Christ has miraculously intervened and changed lives in
        response to prayer and the proclamation of the Gospel. In Pastor
        Kumuyi’s own words: “God, in the growth of Deeper Life Bible Church, has
        strategically and prudently used miracles to ‘make all men come to Him’
        (John 3:26). We take Christian living and holiness seriously.” According
        to Isaacson, The history of Deeper Life is very much the personal story
        of W.F. Kumuyi. He is a gifted man, clear-thinking and humble. He is a
        dedicated Christian and deserves the title ‘the man of God,’ which his
        followers have given him. Since he was a young man, Kumuyi has devoted
        his time to reading and studying the Bible. He knows the Scriptures
        inside out, and has struggled to understand and apply them. As he shares
        that struggle and his love for the word of God, so people have been
        drawn to him for advice, or simply to listen. When he preaches, his
        message is clear, simple, and profound. Poor street traders who can
        barely read sit next to university professors, all equally captivated by
        the way Scripture becomes suddenly relevant to them. Pastor Kumuyi’s own
        Christian life developed because he took the Bible so seriously, and so
        the Deeper Christian Life Ministry has developed in the same way. In
        Alan Isaacson’s own words, he “preached Deeper Life into existence”. His
        sermons were captivating, wrote Isaacson, “I would classify him as one
        of the greatest living preachers, giving a straightforward Bible-based
        message, his sermons thorough, and always personally challenging. He
        always gave a wide range of cross-references which were read in their
        context, supporting, clarifying and expanding his main points. He spoke
        clearly and authoritatively to the Nigerian situation. He dealt
        sensitively with African culture, but also made a firm stand in
        highlighting the points where local culture was incompatible with the
        will of God. While stressing the high moral tone which is one of the
        virtues of most African cultures at their best, he was at pains to
        specify those aspects of local culture which were unchristian and even
        evil. In this way he was not only concerned with some kind of personal
        holiness, but also genuinely seeking the wholeness and harmony of the
        community at large, where truth, honesty, and justice should be the
        predominant characteristics.
