    <h1 class="gook">WHAT WE BELIEVE</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h1 class="bi">BIBLE DOCTRINES: ABRIDGED EDITION</h1>
    <h1>Acts 2:42; I Timothy 4:16; Titus 1:9</h1>

    <p>
      “Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common
      salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort [you] that
      ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto
      the saints”. “Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in
      them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear
      thee”. “Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and
      offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.”
      (Jude 3; Romans 16:17; I Timothy 4:16)
    </p>

    God’s infallible WORD teaches and we believe:

    <h1>The Holy Bible</h1>
    That the Holy Bible, consisting of 39 books of the Old Testament and 27
    books of the New Testament, is the inspired Word of God. We take the Bible
    as final authority in all matters concerning Christian conduct and work. (2
    Timothy 3:16,17; Proverbs 30:5,6; Revelation 22:18,19.)

    <h1>The Godhead</h1>
    That the Godhead consists of three separate, distinct, and recognisable
    personalities and qualities, perfectly united in one. The Father, the Son,
    and the Holy Ghost are different Persons in the Godhead, not merely three
    names for one Person. (Matthew 3:16,17; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Matthew
    28:19,20.)

    <h1>The Virgin Birth of Jesus</h1>
    The virgin birth of Jesus, the only begotten Son of God as well as His
    crucifixion, death, burial and bodily resurrection. (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew
    1:18-25; Romans 1:4; I Corinthians 15:3,4.)

    <h1>Total Depravity, Sinfulness and Guilt of All Men</h1>
    The total depravity, sinfulness and guilt of all men since the Fall,
    rendering them subject to God’s wrath and condemnation. (Psalm 51:5; Job
    14:4; Romans 3:23; 5:12-17; Mark 7:21-23; Ephesians 2:1.)

    <h1>Repentance</h1>
    That Repentance is a complete turning away from all sins and its deceitful
    pleasures and that it is required from every sinner before he can truly and
    effectively believe in Jesus with saving faith. (Proverbs 28:13; Isaiah
    55:7; Ezekiel 18:21-23; Mark 1:15; Luke 24:46,47; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 20:20,21;
    2 Corinthians 7:10; Hebrews 6:1-3.)

    <h1>Restitution</h1>
    That Restitution is making amends for wrongs done against our fellow-men,
    restoring stolen things to their rightful owners, paying debts, giving back
    where one has defrauded, making confessions to the offended and apologizing
    to those slandered so as to have a conscience void of offence toward God and
    man. (Genesis 20:1-8,14-18; Exodus 22:1-7; Leviticus 6:1-7; Numbers 5:6-8; 2
    Samuel 12:1-6; Proverbs 6:30,31; Ezekiel 33:14-16; Matthew 5:23,24; Luke
    19:8,9; Acts 23:1-5; 24:16; James 4:17.)

    <h1>Justification</h1>
    That Justification is God’s grace through which one receives forgiveness and
    remission of sins and is counted righteous before God, through faith in the
    atoning blood of Jesus. Having thus been cleared of every guilt of sin, the
    regenerated stands before God as though he had never sinned, not on the
    basis of any personal merit but in the light of what Christ had accomplished
    for mankind by His substitutionary death on the cross at Calvary. (Psalm
    32:1,2; Isaiah 1:18; Micah 7:19; Acts 13:38.)

    <h1>Water Baptism</h1>
    That water Baptism is essential to our obedience after reconciliation with
    God. Water Baptism is one immersion (not three) “In the name of the Father,
    and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost”, as Jesus commanded. (Matthew 28:19;
    3:13-17; Mark 16:15,16; Acts 2:38;8:38,39; 19:1-5; Romans 6:4,5.)

    <h1>The Lord’s Supper</h1>
    That the Lord’s supper was instituted by Jesus Christ so that all believers
    (all members of the family of God) might partake thereof regularly, to “shew
    the Lord’s death till he come”. The emblems used are “unleavened bread” and
    the juice of “fruit of the vine”. Anyone who eats and drinks unworthily
    brings “damnation”, punishment and chastisement upon himself. (Matthew
    26:29; Luke 22:17-20; I Corinthians 11:23-30.)

    <h1>Entire Sanctification</h1>
    That Entire Sanctification is a definite act of God’s grace, subsequent to
    the New Birth, by which the believer’s heart is purified and made holy. It
    cannot be attained progressively by works, struggle or suppression, but it
    is obtained by faith in the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ. Holiness of
    life and purity of heart are central to Christian living. (Luke 1:74,75;
    John 17:15-17; I Thessalonians 4:3,7,8; 5:22-24; Ephesians 5:25-27; Hebrews
    2:11; 10:10,14; 13:11,12; Titus 2:11-14; I John 1:7; Hebrews 12:14; I Peter
    1:14-16.)

    <h1>Holy Ghost Baptism</h1>
    That the Baptism in the Holy Ghost is the enduement of power from on High
    upon the sanctified believer. It is “the promise of the Father” and when one
    receives this “gift of the Holy Ghost”, it is accompanied by the initial
    evidence of speaking a language unlearned previously, referred to as
    speaking in tongues as the Spirit gives utterance. We do not teach or
    instruct people how to speak in tongues: the Holy Spirit gives utterance. We
    also stress the necessity of purity before power. The Gifts of the Spirit
    are for believers today. (Matthew 3:11; Acts 1:8; Luke 3:16; 24:49; John
    1:30-33; 7:37-39; 14:16,17,26; 15:26; 16:12-15; Acts 1:5-8; Mark 16:17; Acts
    2:1-18; 10:44-46; Acts 19:1-6; I Corinthians 12:1-31; 14:1-40.)

    <h1>Redemption, Healing and Health</h1>
    That Redemption from the curse of the law, Healing of sickness and disease
    as well as continued Health are provided for all people through the
    sacrificial death of Jesus Christ. (Exodus 15:26; Deuteronomy 7:15; Psalm
    103:1-5; Proverbs 4:20-22; Isaiah 53:4,5; Matthew 8:16,17; I Peter 2:24;
    Mark 16;15-18; Luke 13:16; John 14:12-14; 10:10; Acts 10:38; James 5:14-16;
    3 John 2 Galatians 3:13,14.)

    <h1>Personal Evangelism</h1>
    That Personal Evangelism is a God-given and God-ordained ministry for every
    believer. Jesus commanded and God requires every believer to be a
    compassionate and fruitful soulwinner, bringing others to Christ. (Matthew
    28:19,20; Mark 16:15; Luke 24:46-49; John 17:18; Acts 1:8; 1-4; Psalm
    126:5,6; Proverbs 11:30; Daniel 12:3; Ezekiel 3:17-21.)

    <h1>Marriage</h1>
    That Marriage is binding for life. Monogamy is the uniform teaching of the
    Bible. Polygamy is contrary to God’s perfect will and institution. Also,
    under the New Testament dispensation, no one has a right to divorce and
    remarry while the first companion lives. When a person becomes converted,
    necessary restitution, on this line, must be done without delay if he has
    married wrongly. (Genesis 2:24; Deuteronomy 7:1-4; Job 23:11-13; 2
    Corinthians 6:14-18; Proverbs 31:10-31; Malachi 2:14,15; Romans 7:2,3;
    Ephesians 5:31-33; Matthew 5;31,32; 19:3-9; Mark 10:2-12; Luke 16:18; John
    4:15-19; Genesis 20:3-7.)

    <h1>The Rapture</h1>
    That the Rapture (commonly referred to as the first phase or stage of the
    SECOND COMING OF CHRIST) is the catching away from the earth, of all living
    saints and all who died in the Lord. The Rapture will take place before the
    Great Tribulation and can happen any time from now. “In a twinkling of an
    eye” without a moment’s warning, “the trumpet shall sound” “and the dead in
    Christ shall rise first; then we which are alive and remain shall be caught
    up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so
    shall we ever be with the Lord.” (John 14:1-3; Luke 21:34-36; I Corinthians
    15:51-58; I Thessalonians 4:13-18; 5:4-9; 2 Thessalonians 2:5-7; Philippians
    3:11,20,21; I John 3:1-3.)

    <h1>The Resurrection of The Dead</h1>
    That the Resurrection of the dead is taught in the Bible as clearly as the
    immortality of the soul. Every individual who has ever lived will be
    resurrected, some to honour and glory and others to everlasting shame and
    contempt. (Job 19:25-27; Psalm 71:20; Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2; John
    5:28,29; I Corinthians 15:12-57; I Thessalonians 4:13-16; Hebrews 6:1,2;
    Philippians 3:8-11; Revelation 20:4,6,12,13.)

    <h1>The Great Tribulation</h1>
    That the Great Tribulation will occur after the Rapture and will be a time
    of terrible suffering on earth. It is also referred to as the time of
    “Jacob’s trouble”. During this time, the Antichrist will take possession of
    this world for a reign of terror. He will not be a system or organization
    but a person – a supernatural, diabolical being, in the form of a man who
    will blaspheme and proclaim himself to be God. The Marriage Supper of the
    Lamb will take place above while the Tribulation continues on earth.
    (Matthew 24:21,22,29; Revelation 9:16; Mark 13:19; 2 Thessalonians 2:3-12;
    Revelation 13. Daniel 8:23-25; 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12; Revelation 13:1-10.
    Revelation 19:1-10.)

    <h1>The Second Coming of Christ</h1>
    That the Second Coming of Christ will be just as literal and visible as His
    going away, and He is coming to execute judgement upon the ungodly. He will
    also, then, set up His Kingdom and reign on this present earth for a
    thousand years. (Zechariah 14:3,4; Matthew 25:31-46; 26:64; Mark 13:24-37; 2
    Thessalonians 1:7-10; 2:8; Jude 14,15.)

    <h1>Christ’s Millennial Reign</h1>
    That Christ’s Millennial Reign is the 1,000 years literal reign of Jesus on
    earth, which will be ushered in by the coming of Jesus back to earth with
    ten thousands of His saints. At this time He will judge the nations that
    dwell upon the face of the earth. During this time, the devil will be bound.
    It will be a reign of peace and blessing. (Jude 14,15; 2 Thessalonians
    1:7-10. Revelation 20:2,3. Isaiah 11:6-9; 65:25; Hosea 2:18; Zechariah
    14:9-20; Isaiah 2:2-4.)

    <h1>The Great White Throne Judgement</h1>
    That the Great White Throne Judgement is when God finally judges all (the
    living and the dead, small and great) who have ever lived on the face of the
    earth, according to their works. This is after the Millennium. At this time,
    the final Judgement known as the Great White Throne Judgement will be held.
    All those, from all ages, who have not yet been judged believers’ judgement
    for sin, borne and accomplished by Christ on the Cross will stand before God
    at this time. The devil and his angels are judged at this time also and sent
    to the lake of fire forever. (John 5:24; 3:17-19. Daniel 12:2,3; Matthew
    10:15; 11:21-24,12:41,42; John 5:28,29; Romans 2:15,16; 14:12; 2 Peter 2:9;
    Jude 6; I Corinthians 6:1-4; Acts 10:42; Revelation 20:11-15.)

    <h1>The New Heaven and The New Earth</h1>
    That the New Heaven and the New Earth “wherein dwelleth righteousness” will
    be made by God and the redeemed shall dwell therein with God forever. This
    present earth which has been polluted by sin will pass away after the Great
    White Throne Judgement. No unclean thing will be there. There, we shall know
    each other, our knowledge having been perfected. There will be no more curse
    upon anything. There will be no more night; the glory of the Lord will be
    the light thereof. (Psalm 102:25,26; Isaiah 51:6; 65:17; Matthew 5:18;
    24:35; 2 Peter 3:10-13; Revelation 21:1- Isaiah 66:22; 2 Peter 3:12,13; I
    Corinthians 13:12; I John 3:2,3; Revelation 21:1-7; 22:1-5.)

    <h1>Hell</h1>
    That Hell fire is a place of everlasting punishment where sinners (all who
    do not have their names in the book of life) will suffer torments for ever
    and ever. It was prepared for the devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41) but
    God has decreed that the wicked and those who forget Him and reject Christ
    will also be cast there because of their sin and neglect of His salvation.
    (Psalm 9:17; Matthew 25:46; Luke 12:4,5; 16:19-31; Matthew 5:22,30; Mark
    9:43-47; Revelation 14:10,11; 20:10,12,15.)
